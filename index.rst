***************
Examples
***************
Example 1: Blinking an LED
==========================

Introduction
------------

     In this example you are learning how to turn on and off a LED or any other actuator which can be controlled by a digital output such as relay, bulb, motor.

Learning Outcomes
------------------

 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Pin Mode
-  Digital Write
-  Delay Functions

Components
----------

- Magicbit

Theory
------

 A digital output allows you to control a voltage with an electronic device. If the device instructs the output to be high, the output will produce a voltage (generally about 5 or 3.3 volts). If the device instructs the output to be low, it is connected to ground and produces no voltage.Here Magicbit is the device and output voltage is either 3.3V for HIGH and 0V for LOW.

Methodology
-----------

 Magicbit equipped with four onboard leds in Magicbit development board, Lets select yellow LED (which is wired to D18)

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image4.png?raw=true

 By setting output state to high of LED pin will turn on the led and by setting output state to LOW will turn of LED.

Coding
------

 .. code-block:: c

     void setup(){
	pinMode(18,OUTPUT);
     }
     void loop(){
	digitalWrite(18,HIGH);
	delay(1000);
	digitalWrite(18,LOW);
	delay(1000);
     }

Explanation
-----------

 **pinMode(pin, Mode):** Configures the specified pin to behave either as an input or an output. Here we use pin as an output

 **digitalWrite(pin No, State):** Write a HIGH or a LOW value to a digital pin.Pin mode must be setup for the same pin in Setup to work this function properly.

 **delay(ms):** Pauses the program for the amount of time (in milliseconds) specified as parameter.(note 1000 milliseconds equals to one second)

**Note: Write code for a knight rider pattern using on board leds of Magicbit**


Example 2: Reading the state of a push button
=============================================

Introduction
------------
     In this example you are learning how read a digital input from something like a button & use it to turn on and off a LED or any other digital device.

Learning Outcomes
--------------------
 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Digital Read
-  IF-ELSE conditions
-  Variables

Components
-------------
- Magicbit

Theory
------------
 A digital input allows you to read digital signals. Microcontroller recognizes the signal as 1(HIGH) when the signal is close to 3.3v (or 5v depending on the microcontroller) and recognizes as 0(LOW) when the signal is close to 0v. This reading can be used in the program to do various things.  

Methodology
-----------
 Magicbit equipped with two onboard push buttons in Magicbit development board, Lets select the push button which is wired to D34. Buttons on the board are in pulled up internally (to learn more about pullups/pulldowns follow this link), which means when button is not pressed the status of the button is 1(HIGH), & when the button is pressed the status of the button is 0(LOW).

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image7.png?raw=true

 Also like in previous example we need to select an LED to indicate the change, lets select RED LED which is wired to pin D27.

 First we set the input output configurations of the Button and the LED using pinMode, in this case button is an INPUT, LED is an OUTPUT.
 Then in the loop section we check the state of the button & store it in an int type variable called buttonState (follow this link to learn more about data types in arduino).

 Then we can use the variable as the condition of the if block, and if the button is pressed, the bulb should turn on, and the button is not pressed the light should turn off. 

Coding
----------
 .. code-block:: c

     void Setup(){
	pinMode(27,OUTPUT);
	pinMode(34,INPUT);
     }
     void loop(){

      int buttonState = digitalRead(34);
      if(buttonState == LOW){
	digitalWrite(27, HIGH);
      }else{
	digitalWrite(27, LOW);
      }
     }

Explanation
--------------
 **digitalRead(pin No):** Reads the condition of the given pin and returns a digital value HIGH or LOW.

 **IF/ELSE:** Used to evaluate a digital condition, we can put a digital logic condition in then parenthesis. If the condition is true, it executes the code block in the immediate curly bracket section, if the condition is false it executes the code block in the else curly bracket. 

  if(condition){
	//Do if condition is true
  }else{
	//Do if condition is false}


**Note: Write a code to toggle an LED in the button press. LED turns on when button pressed & released, LED turns off when button is pressed & released again. (Hint: Make use of variables to ‘remember’ the state of the button press).**


Example 3: Working with Analog Write
====================================

Introduction
---------------
     In this example you are learning how to turn on and off a LED or any other actuator which can be controlled by a digital output such as relay, bulb, motor.

Learning Outcomes
-------------------
 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Pulse Width Modulation
-  Analog Write

Components
------------

- Magicbit

Theory
-----------

 To change the brightness of a LED we could change the voltage the LED is supplied with, but in a microcontroller, ability to change the voltage (converting a digital number to an analog voltage) is limited, so a method called PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is used. What this does is pulsing on and off the pin in a high frequency. The length of the pulses creates the perception of brightness. 

 Duty cycle is a term used to describe the ratio between on and off times.

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image8.png?raw=true

 In this example higher Duty cycle gives higher brightness & lower duty cycle gives lower brightness.

Methodology
-------------
 Lets select green LED (which is wired to D16). We will use a for loop to generate the duty cycle (0 - 0% duty, 255-100% duty). And also to generate 255 cycles.

Coding
------
 .. code-block:: c

  #include <ESP32Servo.h>

  void setup(){
        pinMode(16,OUTPUT);
  }
  void loop(){
	for(int i = 0; i < 256; i++){
	analogRead(16, i);
	delay(10);
  }

Explanation
------------
 **for(int i=0; i<256; i++):** There are 3 parameters in a for loop, first parameter we are defining a variable to store the value generated by the for loop. Second parameter specifies the condition that needs to be true to run the for loop(else it breaks out from the loop), third parameter specifies the change happens to the variable in each cycle, in this case 1, added to i. 

 **analogWrite(pin number, pwm value):** You can input the pin number you need to do pwm and then the pwm value you need to give to that pin. This assigns the corresponding duty cycle to the pin.


**Note This example we have coded to increase the brightness, write a code to do the opposite of that, to fade the brightness of the led, & put both effects together to create a beautiful fade & light up effect.**


Example 4: Using Serial Protocol
=================================

Introduction
------------
     In this example you are learning to use serial communication function.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Serial Protocol usage between Magicbit & the PC


Components
----------

- Magicbit
- Computer with arduino installed

Theory
-------
 In microcontroller programming, communication between devices is essential. There are hundreds of protocols available, but most common & easy to use is Serial Protocol. Commonly used to communicate information between a microcontroller and a computer.

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image3.png?raw=true

Methodology
-----------
   
 We configure a button as the 2nd example (D34 is used). Then we initialize serial communication between the computer and Magicbit. 
 After that in the loop section if condition check if the button is pressed. If pressed, it prints “Button Pressed” on the serial console.  

 You could use the serial monitor window of arduino IDE to view the serial output

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image5.png?raw=true
 
 Then the serial console appears (you have to select the serial port number correctly, follow this link to learn how to). 

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image6.png?raw=true

 **1:** You can type in stuff here & hit enter to send data to Magicbit
 
 **2:** This area shows the data coming from Magicbit
 
 **3:** From this menu you have to select a common baudrate between the computer and the magic    bit.

Coding
------
 .. code-block:: c

     void setup(){
       pinMode(34,INPUT);
       Serial.begin(9600);
     }
     void loop(){
       if(digitalRead(34) == LOW){
         Serial.println(“Button is Pressed”);
       }
     }


Explanation
-----------
 **Serial.begin(baudrate):** Initializes a serial connection, baudrate specifies the speed of data transfer (bits per second). Standard values are 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200, 128000 and 25600

 **Serial.print(stuff to print):** Using this function, serial data can be sent, stuff to print can be any type of arduino variable, or even a static string.

 **Serial.println(stuff to print):** Using this function, serial data can be sent, stuff to print can be any type of arduino variable, or even a static string, this is different than Serial.print() is this always prints the content in a new line, rather than printing all in one line.

Activity
---------
**Note: do the same example using Serial.print(), observe the difference.  Create a button press counter, which displays the button press count on the serial console of arduino IDE.**

Example 5: Reading an Analog Signal
===================================

Introduction
-------------

     In this example you are learning to read an analog sensor & print it on the serial console.

Learning Outcomes
------------------

 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Analog Read function


Components
-----------

- Magicbit

Theory
-------

 In real world most of the signals we encounter are analog signals (temperature, air pressure, velocity), they are continuous. But computers work on digital domain, to interact between the worlds, representing an analog signal in the digital domain is important. 
 (to read more about analog to digital conversation, follow this link)

Methodology
------------

 For this example we use the potentiometer on the Magicbit board, which is connected to pin, D39. It generates a voltage between 0 and 3.3V according to the angle of the potentiometer. 

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image1.png?raw=true

 We read the analog signal and storing it in an int type variable(0v= 0 analog value, 3.3v = 1024 analog value), sensorValue, later, we use this value to print on the serial window of arduino IDE as well as light up the  red LED(D27) if the analog value exceeds than 512.

Coding
------
 .. code-block:: c

   void setup(){
	pinMode(39,INPUT);
	pinMode(27,OUTPUT)
	Serial.begin(9600);
   }
   void loop(){
	int sensorValue = analogRead(39);
	Serial.println(sensorValue);
	
        if(sensorValue > 512){
	   digitalWrite(27,HIGH);
        }else{
	   digitalWrite(27,LOW);
        }
    }

Explanation
-----------
 **analogRead(pin No):** this reads and assigns the corresponding analog value to the left.

Activity
---------

**Note: Do the same example using the LDR on the board (D36)**

Example 6: Generating Tones
=============================

     In this example you are learning to generate a tone using the onboard buzzer on the Magicbit.

Learning Outcomes
------------------

 From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

-  Tone Function

Components
-----------

- Magicbit

Theory
-------
 Piezo buzzers are commonly used in embedded systems to give audible tones. Combined with ESPservo library Magicbit can generate various tones. (Follow this link to know how to install ESPservo library)

Methodology
-----------
 For this example we use the piezo buzzer wired to pin 25 of the Magicbit. 

 .. image:: https://github.com/Ruwatech/docu-Magicbit/blob/master/Resources/image2.png?raw=true

 ESP32Servo.h library is used to generate pwm signals needed to generate tones. We could specify the frequency & duration of the tone. 

Coding
-------
 .. code-block:: c

  #include <ESP32Servo.h>
  void Setup(){
     pinMode(25,OUTPUT);
  }
  void loop(){
     tone( 25 ,4186,500); //C Note
     delay(1000);
     tone( 25,5274,500); //E Note
     delay(1000);
  }

Explanation
-----------
 **tone(pin No, frequency, duration):** generates pwm to corresponding to the given parameters

Activity
--------
**Note:: Create a program that plays one frequency when one push button on the board pressed, and another frequency when the other push button when pressed.**

Theory
---------
 Magicbit has a 0.96" OLED Screen which can be communicated with from I2C protocol. The display has the address, **0x3c**.

Methodology
-------------
 Adafruit OLED library(Adafruit_SSD1306 & Adafruit_GFX) is used to handle the LCD, its important to install those libraries beforehand. First we create the content we need to print onto the screen and then use display.display command to update the screen.

Coding
---------
 .. code-block:: c

  #include <Wire.h>
  #include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
  #include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>
  #define OLED_RESET 4

  Adafruit_SSD1306 display(128,64);

  void setup(){
    display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C);
    display.display();
    delay(3000);
  }


  void loop(){
    display.clearDisplay();
    display.setTextSize(2);
    display.setTextColor(WHITE);
    display.setCursor(10, 0);
    display.println("Hello");
  
    display.setTextColor(WHITE);
    display.setTextSize(1);
    display.setCursor(0, 25);
    display.println("Welcome to");
    display.println();
    display.println("Magic");
    display.println("Bit");
    display.display();
    display.clearDisplay();
  
    delay(1000);

    }

Explanation
-----------

 **display.clearDisplay():** Clears the OLED display.

 **display.setTextSize(2):** Set the font size of the text.

 **display.setCursor(0, 25):** Sets the cursor(determines where the next text will appear).

 **display.println(stuff to print):** print the data given on a new line, similar effect like Serial.println.

================

3.1 Introduction
-----------------

A flame sensor module that consists of a flame sensor (IR receiver), resistor, capacitor, potentiometer, and comparator LM393 in an integrated circuit. It can detect infrared light with a wavelength ranging from 700nm to 1000nm.

**Learning outcomes:**

•	Using flame sensor for identify infrareds/heat bodies

3.2 Components
---------------

•	Magicbit
•	Magicbit Flame Sensor

3.3 Theory
-----------

IR receiver mainly use with a IR Transmitter, not only for identify heat bodies. IR light is emitted by the sun, light bulbs, and anything else that produces heat. That means there is a lot of IR light noise all around us. To prevent this noise from interfering with the IR signal, a signal modulation technique is used. In IR signal modulation, an encoder on the IR remote converts a binary signal into a modulated electrical signal. This electrical signal is sent to the transmitting LED. The transmitting LED converts the modulated electrical signal into a modulated IR light signal. The IR receiver then demodulates the IR light signal and converts it back to binary before passing on the information to a microcontroller.In here we use this sensor for identify flames.

3.4 Methodology
----------------

As the first step, you should connect a Magicbit flame sensor to Magicbit core board. For this, you can use one side connector from four side connectors of the Magicbit core board or if you want to extend the length the connection, you can use jumper wires.
For this example, the flame sensor was connected to the upper left connector of the Magicbit core board.
Then connect the Magicbit to your pc and upload the code.
You can get outputs using serial monitor.

3.5 Coding
-----------
.. code-block:: c

    const int FLAMEpin = 32;

    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(9600);
      pinMode (FLAMEpin, INPUT);
    }

    void loop() {
      Serial.println(analogRead(FLAMEpin));
      delay(100);
    }


3.6 Explanation
----------------

Here we give an **analogRead**. That because we have to measure a range to take a decision that is there a flame or not.


04. DOOR Sensor
================

4.1 Introduction
-----------------

A magnetic contact switch is a reed switch encased in a plastic shell so that you can easily apply them in a door, a window or a drawer to detect if the door is open or closed.

**Learning outcomes:**

•	Using magnetic door sensor.

4.2 Components
---------------

•	Magicbit
•	Magicbit Magnetic door sensor

4.3 Theory
----------

Almost all door and window sensors use a "reed switch" to determine when a protected area has been breached.  A reed switch consists of a set of electrical connectors placed slightly apart. When a magnetic field is placed parallel to the electrical connectors, it pulls them together, closing the circuit. Door sensors have one reed switch and one magnet, creating a closed circuit. If someone opens an armed door or window, the magnet is pulled away from the switch, which breaks the circuit and triggers an event.  [2]

05. Magicbit Servo
==================

5.1 Introduction
----------------

A servomotor is an electrical device, which can push or rotate an object with great precision. If you want to rotate and object at some specific angles or distance, then you use servomotor. It is just made up of simple motor, which run through servomechanism.

**Leaning outcome:**

•	Using servo motor with Magicbit

5.2 Components
---------------

•	Magicbit
•	Servomotor

5.3 Theory
-----------

Servo motor works on the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) principle, which means its angle of rotation, is controlled by the duration of pulse applied to its control PIN. Servomotor is made up of DC motor, which is controlled by a variable resistor (potentiometer), and some gears. Servomotors control position and speed very precisely. Now a potentiometer can sense the mechanical position of the shaft. Hence, it couples with the motor shaft through gears. The current position of the shaft is converted into electrical signal by potentiometer, and is compared with the command input signal. In modern servomotors, electronic encoders or sensors sense the position of the shaft.
A pulse of 1ms will move the shaft anticlockwise at -90 degree, a pulse of 1.5ms will move the shaft at the neutral position that is 0 degree and a pulse of 2ms will move shaft clockwise at +90 degree. [3]

Then connect the magic servo motor t magic bit.
After completed those steps, upload following code for your Magicbit.

5.5 Coding
-----------
.. code-block:: c

    #include <ESP32Servo.h>
    Servo MagicServo;

    void setup() {
    MagicServo.attach(32);
     }

    void loop( ) {
     for(int i=0; i<=180; i++){
      MagicServo.write(i);
      delay(10);
      }
    }


5.6 Explanation
---------------

**Servo MagicServo:** We should create an object in program for define the servomotor
**MagicServo.attach:** ‘attach’ means define which pin of the Magicbit connects to the servomotor.
**For loop:** In here, we use for loop to incrementing loop action. Because of this the servomotor increments its angle 0 to 180 and after complete this action reset to the start position. This action is continued repeatedly inside the ‘for loop’.


06. Motion Sensor
=================

6.1 Introduction
----------------

A motion sensor (or motion detector) is an electronic device that is designed to detect and measure movement. Motion sensors are used primarily in home and business security systems. PIR Sensor is short for passive infrared sensor, which applies for projects that need to detect human or particle movement in a certain range, and it can be referred as PIR (motion) sensor, or IR sensor. [4]

**Learning outcomes:**

•	Using motion sensor
•	Theoretical background of using Infrared waves in motion sensor

6.2 Components
---------------
•	Magicbit
•	Magicbit Motion sensor

6.3 Theory
------------

When a human or animal body will get in the range of the sensor, it will detect a movement because the human or animal body emits heat energy in a form of infrared radiation. That is where the name of the sensor comes from, a Passive Infra-Red sensor. In addition, the term “passive” means that sensor is not using any energy for detecting purposes; it just works by detecting the energy given off by the other objects.

.. image:: https://github.com/HarshaWeerasinghe/MagicBit_Sensors/blob/master/resources/MotionSensor/Screenshot_3.png?raw=true

Figure 12: PIR Sensor –Howtomechatronics.com


6.4 Methodology
---------------

First, connect the motion sensor to your Magicbit and upload the following code to your Magicbit. In this demonstration like other demonstrations, we use D32 as the data pin.

6.5 Coding
------------
.. code-block:: c

    int MOTIONsensor =32;
    void setup() {
      pinMode(MOTIONsensor, INPUT);
      Serial.begin(9600);
    }
    void loop() {
      Serial.println(digitalRead(MOTIONsensor));
    }


6.6 Explanation
----------------

When some human being detected by the motion sensor, which is in the range of the sensor, the output of the serial monitor, will be displayed ‘1’. If not there will be displayed ‘0’.



07. RGB Module
===============

7.1 Introduction
-----------------

An RGB LED has 4 pins, one for each color (Red, Green, Blue) and a common cathode. It has three different color-emitting diodes that can be combined to create all sorts of color.
R- Red
G- Green
B- Blue

**Learning outcomes:**

•	Using a RGB led and changing its color as the required

7.2 Components
---------------

•	Magicbit
•	RGB module

7.3 Theory
------------

The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green, and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors, red, green, and blue.
The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing, representation, and display of images in electronic systems, such as televisions and computers, though it has also been used in conventional photography. Before the electronic age, the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it, based in human perception of colors [5].

7.4 Methodology
----------------

For this demonstration, you have to install Adafruit NeoPixel library. For more details Click here.
As usually connect the RGB module to your Magicbit, for this, we take data pin as pin 32.
After connect the RGB module to the Magicbit, connect it to your pc and upload following code.

7.5 Coding
-----------

.. code-block:: c

    #include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
    #define LED_PIN  32
    #define LED_COUNT 1
    Adafruit_NeoPixel LED(1,32, NEO_RGB + NEO_KHZ800);

    void setup() {
      LED.begin();
      LED.show();
    }

    void loop() {
      LED.setPixelColor(0, 255, 0, 255); // you can change these arguments and make your own designs using                 those commands. Follow the link in our documentary for more details.
      LED.show();
    }


7.6 Explanation
----------------

Adafruit NeoPixel library is for LED strips. However, it can be used for single RGB LED as your requirement (like this example).
‘LED.begin & LED.show’ are functions of Adafruit NeoPixel library for display the color on RGB led.
‘LED.setPixelColor’ is use to color led brightness values. (Eg:- 255 – maximum brightness & 0 – lowest brightness)


08. Magnetic Sensor
====================

8.1 Introduction
-----------------
 Magnetic sensors are able to detect magnetic fields and process this information. The outcome on the position, angle and strength (Hall Effect) or the direction (Magneto Resistive) of an applied magnetic field can be converted into specific output signals.

**Learning outcomes:**

•	Using Hall Effect sensor and detect magnetic fields.
•	Applications of Hall Effect Sensor


8.2 Components
---------------
•	Magicbit
•	Soil Moisture Sensor


8.3 Theory
------------

There are actually, two different types of Hall sensors one is Digital Hall sensor and the other is Analog Hall sensor. The digital Hall sensor can only detect if a magnet is present or not (0 or 1) but an analog hall sensor’s output varies based on the magnetic field around the magnet that is it can detect how strong or how far the magnet is. In this project will aim only at the digital Hall sensors for they are the most commonly used ones. [6]

In a Hall Effect sensor, a thin strip of metal has a current applied along it. In the presence of a magnetic field, the electrons in the metal strip are deflected toward one edge, producing a voltage gradient across the short side of the strip (perpendicular to the feed current).

8.4 Methodology
----------------

Connect the magnetic sensor to the Magicbit. For this demonstration, we connect the magnetic sensor to D32 pin of the Magicbit.
After connect the magnetic sensor to the Magicbit connect it to your pc and upload the code below.


8.5 Coding
-----------
.. code-block:: c

    #define MAGNETICsensor 32
    void setup() {
      Serial.begin(9600);
      pinMode(32, INPUT);
    }
    void loop() {  
    Serial.println(digitalRead(MAGNETICsensor));  
    delay(100);
    }


8.6 Explanation
----------------

This Magnetic sensor gives digital outputs. Therefor you can open the serial monitor and see the outputs.
‘1’ for occurred a magnetic field near to the sensor
‘0’ for there is no any considerable magnetic field near by the sensor


9.0 Soil Moisture Sensor
========================

9.1 Introduction
-----------------

Soil moisture sensors typically refer to sensors that estimate volumetric water content. Another class of sensors measure another property of moisture in soils called water potential; these sensors are usually referred to as soil water potential sensors and include tensiometers and gypsum blocks.

**Learning outcomes:**

•	Using Soil moisture sensor and implement its applications
•	Working principal of soil moisture sensor

9.2 Components
--------------

•	Magicbit
•	Soil Moisture Sensor

9.3 Theory
-----------

Soil Moisture Sensor. Soil moisture is basically the content of water present in the soil. This can be measured using a soil moisture sensor which consists of two conducting probes that act as a probe. It can measure the moisture content in the soil based on the change in resistance between the two conducting plates.

9.4 Methodology
---------------

Connect the soil moisture sensor to the Magicbit. As usually in here also we connect sensor module to the upper left (D32) connector on the Magicbit.
After connect the sensor module put it in to a wet soil mixture for get results.
Then connect the Magicbit to your pc and upload the code below.

9.5 Coding 
-----------
.. code-block:: c

    int SENSOR = 32;
    int output_value ;

    void setup() {

       Serial.begin(9600);
       Serial.println("Reading From the Sensor ...");
       delay(2000);

    }

    void loop() {

       output_value= analogRead(SENSOR);
       output_value = map(output_value,550,0,0,100);
       Serial.print("Mositure : ");
       Serial.print(output_value);
       Serial.println("%");
       delay(1000);
    }

9.6 Explanation
----------------

**‘output_value = map(output_value, 550,0, 0,100)’**  - output_value is an user defined variable. For display a moisture percentage we should map the analog output value of the sensor given according to the sample (the wet soil mixture).
From serial monitor we can get our outputs.



10. Temperature and Humidity Sensor
====================================

10.1 Introduction
------------------

A humidity sensor (or hygrometer) senses, measures and reports both moisture and air temperature. The ratio of moisture in the air to the highest amount of moisture at a particular air temperature is called relative humidity. Relative humidity becomes an important factor when looking for comfort.

**Learning outcomes:**

•	Using DHT11 sensor and getting outputs of temperature and humidity
•	Apply Temperature & Humidity sensor in projects

10.2 Components
----------------

•	Magicbit
•	Temperature and Humidity Sensor

10.3 Theory
-----------

The DHT11 detects water vapor by measuring the electrical resistance between two electrodes. The humidity-sensing component is a moisture holding substrate with electrodes applied to the surface. When water vapor is absorbed by the substrate, ions are released by the substrate, which increases the conductivity between the electrodes. The change in resistance between the two electrodes is proportional to the relative humidity. Higher relative humidity decreases the resistance between the electrodes, while lower relative humidity increases the resistance between the electrodes.
The DHT11 measures temperature with a surface mounted NTC temperature sensor (thermistor) built into the unit. [7]

10.4 Methodology
-----------------

First, you have to download and install library for DHT11. For more details and download the library 
Click here
Connect the Temperature & Humidity sensor to the Magicbit via left upper connector (D32). Then connect the Magicbit to your pc and upload the following code.

10.5 Coding
------------
.. code-block:: c

    #include "DHT.h"
    #define DHTPIN 32
    #define DHTTYPE DHT11
    DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

    void setup() {
     Serial.begin(9600);
     Serial.println(F("DHTxx test!"));
     dht.begin();
    }
    void loop() {
      delay(2000);
      float h = dht.readHumidity();
      float t = dht.readTemperature();
      float f = dht.readTemperature(true);
      if (isnan(h) || isnan(t) || isnan(f)) {
      Serial.println(F("Failed to read from DHT sensor!"));
      return;
    }
      float hif = dht.computeHeatIndex(f, h);
      float hic = dht.computeHeatIndex(t, h, false);
      Serial.print(F("Humidity: "));
      Serial.print(h);
      Serial.print(F("%  Temperature: "));
      Serial.print(t);
      Serial.print(F("°C "));
      Serial.print(f);
      Serial.print(F("°F  Heat index: "));
      Serial.print(hic);
      Serial.print(F("°C "));
      Serial.print(hif);
      Serial.println(F("°F"));
    }
